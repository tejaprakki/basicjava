We asked some questions about what it means by a Computer


What is a Computer?

Computer = Hardware + Software

Hardware

Things you can touch/feel (some you can see outside and some are inside which needs to open the case)

Some examples Mouse, keyboard( can be seen) , CPU,Motherboard,Hard disk(need to open the cover)

Some parts inside laptop

CPU

We talked about 2+2=? Many people answered quickly but then we were asked how we came up with the answer. Due to that question, we talked about the CPU and the RAM.

CPU stands for the Central Processing Unit. This is where all of the processing happens in the computer. 
RAM stands for Random Access Memory. This is where the computer stores memory that can be thrown away once we close a window.

Then we asked the question of 4567*1245=?. This is where everyone answered that we needed a piece of paper we needed to solve it.
Then we were asked what would happen if we got the same question next week. We said we would need the piece of paper again.
This is how RAM works. It does it's calculations on the piece of paper. Once it's done, it throws the paper away. 
Once it's asked again next week, it gets a new scratch paper, does the equation again and throws it away once it's done.

Then we talked about software.

This is the second part of computer.

We asked us what we did with our computer in the last 2 weeks. We got different answers. Some people said watching a movie on youtube, writing on word, using adobe.
These are all softwares. Softwares are also known as programs.

Program is series of steps/ series of actions / series of instructions ( instructions is right technical terminology)

Some examples
Read (instruction: read)
Read book for 10 mins ( instruction: read , data: 10 mins)
Run for 1 hour at 6 miles/hour ( instruction: run, data 1 hour , 6miles/hour)

Decimal System

All of us learned the decimal system. tenths, hundreths, thousanths, etc,.
Using the number 546 we can write it like: (5 * 100) + (4 * 10) + (6 * 1)
It can also be written as (5* 10^2) + (4 * 10^1) + (6 * 10^0)
In this system every number is between 0-9, and base called 10. Deca is 10 and hence it is called decimal

Binary is all about two numbers. 1 and 0.
