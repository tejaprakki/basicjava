Variables:

We are used to create variables in algebra like below

x = 2
Here x is called variable because we can change its value by assigning to another value like

x=3

and 2 , 3 are called constants because they never change ( 2 is 2 always)

Data Types:

  int(14,10)                    -> Numbers
     
string("Teja", "Blakely")       -> Strings(series of alphabets)

double(24.50, 2.5)              -> Numbers with decimals

If you see above we specify in below format

Datatype VariableName = value ;

Strings are represented in double quotes(""). Note : Not variables(ex:name) but their values (ex:"sairama")
Syntax

What is Syntax in Java programming?

It is grammar just in programming and not english

If Statement:

In real life you get different paths based on certain conditions. 
For example if you are more than 15 years old, then you can get driver permit. If not, you have to wait until you aare 15.
This is represented by if , else if and else statements. For example:

    int age = 13;

    if( age > 15){
        System.out.println("you can get drivers permit");
    }else if( age == 15){
        System.out.println("Congratulations. today is the day where you can apply for permit.");
    }else{
        System.out.println("Sorry, please wait till you get 15");
    }

One can put multiple statements (instructions, remember we are telling to computer to do some stuff) between { and }

for example:

   int age = 13;

   if( age > 15){
       System.out.println("you can get drivers permit");
       System.out.println("you can drive now with an adult next to you");
       System.out.println("certain restrictions , apply");
   }else if( age == 15){
       System.out.println("Congratulations. today is the day where you can apply for permit.");
   }else{
       System.out.println("Sorry, please wait till you get 15");
   }

For loop:

One such loop in Java programming is for loop. A "For" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times.

Lets say you are about to run in school playground tracks. You have been asked to run for 10 times on the track.

One time

    int i;  // For counting in loops usually variable name 'i' is used 

    for(i=0 ; i<10 ; i++){
        System.out.println("running :" + (i+1));
    }
The above program will print running statement as 10 times.

Lets see how computer runs the above for program

Step-1 (only one time)

i=0
Step-2

i < 10 ( is 0<10, yes true)
Step-3

System.out.println("running " + (i+1)) ( prints "running 1")
Step-4

i=i+1 ( i will become 1)
Step-5

i<10 ( is 1<10 , yes true)
Step-6

System.out.println("running " + (i+1)) (prints "running 2")
...

...

...

Finally when i becomes 10 and the condition 10<10 becomes false and thats where the loop stops.

so if you observe the 3 parts in for loop are

initialiation -> one time

condition_which_should_return_true_or_false -> each loop time

do_some_increment_which_runs_for_each_loop -> each loop time.
