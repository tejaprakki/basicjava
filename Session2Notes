We recapped what we did last week which is the hardware,software,binary system etc.,

We defined what a bit is. A bit is one binary digit. Bits carry 4 different kinds of values. These are 00, 01, 10, 11.

1 bit can carry 2 values. 2 bits van carry 4 values. 3 bits can carry 8 values. 4 bits can carry 16 bits.
