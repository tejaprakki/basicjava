We recapped what we did last week which is the hardware,software,binary system etc.,

We defined what a bit is. A bit is one binary digit. Bits carry 4 different kinds of values. These are 00, 01, 10, 11.

1 bit can carry 2 values. 2 bits van carry 4 values. 3 bits can carry 8 values. 4 bits can carry 16 values.
5 bits, 32 values. 6 bits, 64 values. 7 bits, 128 values. 8 bits, 256 values.

We also learned our computer details, and how much memory it stores through task manager.
You can also find how much memory your laptop stores through the File Explorer.

We started a "Hello World" java project.
